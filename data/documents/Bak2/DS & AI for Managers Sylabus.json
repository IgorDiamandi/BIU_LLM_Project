The course begins on December 19, 2024, and spans 5 sessions, each lasting from 17:30 to 21:30, totaling 25 academic hours. Participants can choose to attend either on-campus in Ramat Gan or via Zoom. The curriculum covers a comprehensive range of topics in data science and generative AI, including an overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning, supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, model selection, deep learning concepts, reinforcement learning, and the complete data science pipeline process. Additionally, the course delves into data science operation management, focusing on managing data science initiatives, building and managing data science units, and implementing successful organizational ML-OPS processes. Participants will also explore data science tools and technologies, industry trends, real-world use cases, and best practices. The course emphasizes generative AI, including off-the-shelf solutions, platforms, self-development, and hybrid approaches, with key methodologies such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), preferences fine-tuning (PFT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and more. The program also addresses project milestones, technologies, and processes like tokenization, embedding, and vector databases.", "full_text": "COURSE NAME: Data Science & GenAI \u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d8\u05db\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd\n\nCOURSE OVERVIEW: This course is a hybrid workshop designed for technological managers, focusing on data science and generative AI.
