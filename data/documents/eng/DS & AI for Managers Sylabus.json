  "summary": "This hybrid course, offered by Bar-Ilan University's School of High-Tech and Cyber, is designed for technological managers and focuses on Data Science and Generative AI (GenAI). The course spans 5 sessions, totaling 25 academic hours, and is conducted on Mondays and Thursdays from 17:30 to 21:30. Participants can choose to attend either on-campus in Ramat Gan or via Zoom. The curriculum covers a comprehensive range of topics, including an overview of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, model selection, deep learning concepts, reinforcement learning, and the complete data science pipeline process. Additionally, the course delves into data science operation management, including managing the lifecycle of data science initiatives, building and managing data science units, and implementing successful organizational ML-OPS processes. Participants will also explore data science tools and technologies, industry trends, real-world use cases, and best practices. The course emphasizes Generative AI, including off-the-shelf solutions, platforms, self-development, and hybrid approaches. Key methodologies such as Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Preferences Fine-Tuning (PFT), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are covered. The program also addresses project milestones, technologies, and processes like tokenization, embedding, and vector databases.",
