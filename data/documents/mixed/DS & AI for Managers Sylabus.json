  "summary": "The course 'Data Science & GenAI למנהלים טכנולוגיים' is a hybrid workshop designed for data managers, offered by Bar-Ilan University's School of High-Tech and Cyber. The course spans 5 sessions, totaling 25 academic hours, and is conducted on Mondays and Thursdays from 17:30 to 21:30. Participants can choose to attend either on-campus in Ramat Gan or via Zoom. The curriculum covers a comprehensive range of topics in data science and generative AI, including an overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning, supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, model selection, deep learning concepts, reinforcement learning, and the complete data science pipeline process. Additionally, the course delves into data science operation management, focusing on managing data science initiatives, building and managing data science units, ML-OPS processes, and tools and technologies. It also explores industry trends, real-world use cases, large language models, generative AI solutions, and key approaches such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), preferences fine-tuning (PFT), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The course emphasizes project milestones, technologies, and processes, including tokenization, embedding, and vector databases.",
